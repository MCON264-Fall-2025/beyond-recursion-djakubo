Observations:

- Running the recursive fibonacci sequence led to a timeout since computation was getting too expensive. 
  This means it is not an acceptable time complexity
- Running the iterative fibonacci sequence took only a couple of seconds.
- Running the recursive insert last only worked with a small parameter, for large parameters it would return
  a stack overflow
- Running the iterative insert last worked instantaneously

- Iterative is far better than recursive in most scenarios
